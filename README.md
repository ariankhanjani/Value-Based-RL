This repository contains implementations of classic tabular value-based reinforcement learning algorithms. All algorithms are designed for discrete environments from OpenAI Gym, such as FrozenLake, Taxi-v3, and CliffWalking.

You can use this repository to learn, experiment, and compare different tabular RL methods. Each algorithm maintains state or action-value tables and does not use neural networks, making it easy to understand the core principles of RL.
